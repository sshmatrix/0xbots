# 0xAUTH

**0xAUTH.eth** is the client requiring compute resources with its frontend at [0xAUTH.eth.limo](https://0xauth.eth.limo) and a lightweight backend node capable of `POST`, `GET` requests over HTTPS. In this prototype, the backend is callable at [work.inpl.one](https://work.inpl.one). This node also forms the backend of the communication layer mediated by SIWE (Sign-in with Ethereum).
